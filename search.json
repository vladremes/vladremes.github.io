    "text": "I am a zoologist by training with a long-term research focus on the ecology, evolution, and behavior of birds. I work especially with passerines. It is an incredibly diverse monophyletic group of birds (ca. 6000 species), which is ideal for testing evolutionary hypotheses about the origins of their behavioral, ecological, morphological, and physiological traits.\nIn the past, I studied behavior and ecology of the Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) and Great Tit (Parus major). At the same time, I have started to conduct large-scale comparative analyses of passerine ecology, life histories, and behavior. And it still continues. Later on, I have delved into studying avian communities and macroecology. However, a strong evolutionary focus remained dominant in my work.\nIf you are interested in the results of our research, please consult our articles in scientific journals.\nI work at two universities in the Czech Republic, incidentally located in the two most beautiful cities of our country (Palacky University in Olomouc and Charles University in Prague). I teach ecology, evolution, and biodiversity data analysis. Of course, I also mentor students at all levels (bachelor, masters, doctoral). Please, let me know if you are interested in working with me.\nMy research has been generously supported by my universities and by the Czech Science Foundation (GAČR)."
